# Bear Blog Contributions

Before opening a PR, please read the following guidelines.

## Current Contribution Status
Bear Blog is currently **not actively accepting contributions**. Bear is not a community built project but instead a source-available platform.  

The primary purpose of making the Bear Blog source code available is:

- To allow others to use the code for personal, non-commercial projects or to satisfy their curiosity.
- To ensure code transparency, keeping the organization honest and accountable.

## Future Contributions
If our stance on contributions changes in the future, we will update this file with relevant guidelines and requirements. We appreciate your understanding and support.

## Support the Project
If you would like to support Bear Blog, consider upgrading your blog. Upgrading provides additional features and helps fund ongoing development and maintenance of the platform. Your support is always appreciated!
