## Can BōcPress be self-hosted?
BōcPress has been built as a platform and not as an individual blog generator.
It is more like Substack than Hugo. Due to this it isn't possible to individually self-host a BōcPress.

In the future we hope to draft a guide that explains how to set up a self-hosted instance. However, it will not be as easy as a purpose-built individual blog generator.

## Background of BōcPress

BōcPress was chosen because it blends heritage, literature, and modern publishing in a single, memorable name.

“Bōc” comes from the Old English word for book, evoking centuries of literary tradition and the enduring power of the written word.

“Press” signals publishing and dissemination, connecting the platform to both historic printing presses and today’s digital tools.

Together, BōcPress represents a modern platform for writers while honoring the timeless craft of storytelling.

This name reflects our mission: to provide a digital space where stories, ideas, and voices endure, combining elegance, literary heritage, and modern accessibility.
