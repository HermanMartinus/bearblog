## Can BōcPress be self-hosted? 
BōcPress has been built as a platform and not as an individual blog generator.
It is more like Substack than Hugo. Due to this it isn't possible to individually self-host a BōcPress.

In the future we hope to draft a guide that explains how to set up a self-hosted instance. However, it will not be as easy as a purpose-built individual blog generator.
