## Can Bear Blog be self-hosted? 
Bear Blog has been built as a platform and not as an individual blog generator.
It is more like Substack than Hugo. Due to this it isn't possible to individually self-host a Bear Blog.

There are a few Hugo themes that use Bear's stylesheet which you can find on the Hugo theme repository if you really want to self host something that looks like Bear :)

The full documentation for Bear can be found at https://docs.bearblog.dev
