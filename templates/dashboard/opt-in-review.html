    Hi, Herman here  <span class="bear">ʕ •ᴥ•ʔゝ</span>
    <br><br>
    The Internet is full of spam, scams, and SEO goop. I, however, want Bear to remain a bastion of awesomeness.
    This manual review step is to keep junk out while ensuring Bear remains free-to-use.
    <br><br>
    I review new blogs about twice a week. If you'd like to skip the wait and get approved immediately you can
    <a href="{% url 'upgrade' %}">upgrade</a>. This comes with a bunch of neat features and supports the project.
