    Dear Reader,
    <br><br>
    The Internet is awash with spam, scams, and needless clutter. It is my intention that BōcPress remain a haven of quality and refinement.
    This manual review step ensures that only genuine blogs are admitted, while keeping the service freely available.
    <br><br>
    I review new submissions approximately twice a week. Should you wish to bypass the waiting period and gain immediate approval, you may
    <a href="{% url 'upgrade' %}">upgrade</a>. This offers a selection of useful features and supports the continued work of the project.
    <br><br>
    By submitting the form below, you consent to a careful, human review of your blog by the BōcPress team.
