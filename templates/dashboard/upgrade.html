            Bear's relative cost is great when compared to stringing together disparate services.
            <br>
            <br>
            Privacy respecting analytics comes at a premium of <a href="https://usefathom.com/pricing" target="_blank">$14/mo</a>, and hosting and image hosting can cost upwards of <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets" target="_blank">$5/mo</a> a piece.
            Overall a custom built blog can cost upwards of $24/mo.
            <br>
            <br>
            Bear integrates all of these services. You don't even have to buy themes separately. 
            <br>
            <br>
            When compared to other blogging platforms such as Ghost <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/" target="_blank">($9/mo)</a> and Weebly <a href="https://www.weebly.com/za/pricing" target="_blank">($12/mo without ads)</a>, Bear comes in as being faster and more affordable.
            You could choose Wordpress <a href="https://wordpress.com/pricing/" target="_blank">($4/mo)</a>, but who in their right mind wants to use Wordpress?
            <br>
            <br>
            Most importantly, you'll be supporting the small, fast internet, and a blogging platform <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/building-software-to-last-forever" target="_blank">built to last forever</a>.
