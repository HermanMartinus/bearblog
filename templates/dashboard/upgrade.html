    With Bear, you're not just blogging - you're nurturing a space that's truly yours.
    <br>
    <br>
    We don't make money by selling data, tracking readers, or displaying ads.
    We do it by creating <b>something great</b> and charging a fee for it.
    <br>
    <br>
    That's a straightforward business model that's also <b>sustainable</b>.
    <br>
    <br>
    Here's what you get when you upgrade:
    <ul>
        <li>Custom domains</li>
        <li>Show up on the <a href="https://bearblog.dev/discover/" target="_blank">discovery feed</a> and search engines</li>
        <li>Publish up to 10 sites</li>
        <li>Media and file uploading and embedding</li>
        <li>In-depth analytics</li>
        <li>Email subscriber capture</li>
        <li>Add javascript to page content</li>
        <li>Add code to head and footer elements</li>
        <li>Remove Bear branding (but only if you want to)</li>
    </ul>
